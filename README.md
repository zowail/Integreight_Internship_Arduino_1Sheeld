# Integreight_Internship_Arduino_1Sheeld
This repository contains brief description for the 3 Arduino 1Sheeld projects of Integreight internship

Integreight Summer Internship
I worked individually under the supervision of the CTO of Integreight to create 3 simple and fun projects using Arduino Mega and 1Sheeld
All of the three project are uploaded on Instractables.com and all of them are featured projects
And I received an invitation to be a judge in the future competitions that will be held in the future on instructables.com platform

First project:
Controlling an RGB LED with Color Detector Camera
The purpose of this project is to change the color of an RGB LED using my mobile phone camera by using the internal camera sensor that can detects the color of the object and send the data the Arduino 1Sheeld to change the color of the RGB LED to the same color as the detected object.
